# hello-world
Hello there, I'm new to GitHub and I made this account so I can link it with https://www.freecodecamp.com so it helps me in the future.
My name is Jabri Ahmad, I'm a 19 year old Palestinian living in Saudia Arabia. 
I just learned how to edit a new branch and add commmits to it. The tutorial is helpful and I hope I can learn more.
I just woke up and this site was given to me by a dear friend!
